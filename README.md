#Arcade Game

## Introduction
This is a game about a hero who will later save the world and the entire humanity. But before his adventure officially starts, he need to get to the river without being bitten by the bugs. Help this hero to get to the river, and avoid the bugs!

## Getting Started
Open the [index.html](index.html) file with your browser and you are ready to go!

## How to control
The rule is easy. Press the arrow keys, and the hero will go one block on the given direction.

- `Left Arrow Key`: move the hero one block left
- `Right Arrow Key`: move the hero one block right
- `Up Arrow Key`: move the hero one block up
- `Down Arrow Key`: move the hero one block down

## Your enemy
The **bugs**! They are evil, poisonous and they bite! Don't touch them or the hero will die, and the world will be left unsaved! Some of their characteristics:

- They only apprear on the paveway (or, the *buggy highway*), so the lawn is safe
- Not all bugs will move will the same pace. Some are faster, some slower. So be careful.
- They will only move from left to right, so it is always safer to stand behind a bug than in front of it.

## How to win
Use the arrow keys to help the hero to get to the riverside at all cost, but without hitting any bugs! And after successfully doing so, the game will restart and allow you to try again, and again, and again, and again! Isn't that exciting and wonderful?!

## Trouble shooting

###I opened the index file, but it is showing source code only.
Make sure you didn't open it directly on GitHub. Download the game to your computer first, and open the local version of the **index.html** file.

###I downloaded the game, opened the index file, but the page is blank and the game is still not running.  
Make sure you have downloaded the whole folder (with **index.html**, the **css** folder, the **images** folder, and the **js** folder), instead of the **index.html** file only.
